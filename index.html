        <p>My name is Jiaxi Zhou (Josh) and I am currently working towards a dual Bachelors at UQ, at the time of writing, I'm currently in my second year of university. My choice of study is Information Technology and Science, majoring in Software Design and Mathematics. If everything goes according to plan, my graduation ceremony will be at the end of 2020.

        <h1>Dev</h1>
        <br>
        <p>I'm proficient with Java and Python with some basic knowledge in C and C++. I also have experience with databases and SQL.

          <h1>Design</h1>
          <br>
          <p>My deisgn process is to always create rough sketches and low quality wireframes by hand first before moving towards higher fidelity mockups and designs. <br><br>I mainly use Photoshop to create and edit assets, although I do have basic Adobe Illustrator knowledge.

          <h1>Other skills</h1>
          <br>
          <p>Given my studies in mathematics, I am very confident in solving equations and finding solutions in various different ways, strengthening my problem solving abilities. This knowledge can be applied into certain IT fields such as artificial intelligence and facial recognition.
            <br><br>
            I'm also proficient in MATLAB and using it to model real world mathematical problems.

        <p>The journals during this project really helped me reflect and document the work that I did. I think it was a important part of my success thorughout the semester, it was really easy to go back and remind myself using these journals.
          <br><br>
          You can find all my journals posts <a href="https://deco1800-2018.padlet.org/joshua_zhou/ahfpta2v5g7t">here</a>.
          <br><br>
          I've also highlighted some journal posts, they represent important moments during the project or just something that I was proud of that I can show (so anything I've drawn or designed myself).
          <br><br>
          I might refer back to other journal posts in the later sections.

        <p>Part A was the first deadline in the project, it was focused on documentation and cementing what we wanted to do and how we would do it.

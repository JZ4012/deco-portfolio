        <p>The journals during this project really helped me reflect and document the work that I did. I think it was a important part of my success thorughout the semester, it was really easy to go back and remind myself using these journals.

          You can find all my journals posts <a href="https://deco1800-2018.padlet.org/joshua_zhou/ahfpta2v5g7t">here</a>.
          <br><br>
          I've also highlighted some journal posts, they represent important moments during the project or just something that I was proud of that I can show (so anything I've drawn or designed myself).
          <br><br>
          I might refer back to other journal posts in the later sections.

        <p>Part A was the first deadline in the project, it was focused on documentation and cementing what we wanted to do and how we would do it. The task to was to generate a concept document that would reflect the future of this project, and involved details such as the scope, design concept etc.</p>

        <h1>My process</h1>
        <br>
        <p>The process involved was twofold, I focused down the wireframes first as I believed that this was going to be the more difficult task of the two that I was assigned. I started to build the wireframes after one of our contact sessions, where our group had a long discussion on what our pages should look like, figure 1 was the result of that meeting.
          <br><br>
          From this point on, there really wasn't too much to it. I began with creating the home page to set out the general theme/feel of the site, then I went through and did this for all the other pages that we had. I added in the annotations and some other asides to complete the work for this section.
          <br><br>
          The project brief was also very easy to do since I understood what our project was going to be and what the final product was expected to look like.

      <div class="aboutContainer" id="PartBContainer">
        <p>Part B was the second deadline of the project, it involved producing a working demo that would representative of the final product. This meant getting the crucial webpages ready as well as the base functionality. In addition, a progress report was also required.</p>

        <br>
        <p>My work for this part of the project involved the most work out of all the other parts, I was responsible for creating one of our year pages and some of the javascript functionality. This time the report was done only by two people, myself and Brian, as I felt that having too many people work on documentation makes it more difficult to read and put together. I worked on developing the new navigation dashboard as well. I also suggested that each year page should have it's own theme, so that the experience wouldn't feel stale after the first year. This was implemented shortly after the demo session.</p>

      <div class="subBox" id="partBJS">
        <h1>JavaScript</h1>
        <section class="seperator" id="partBJSSep">
        </section>
        <br>
        <p>The work done for JavaScript was minimal on my end. Initially I had planed to do more, however as a result of both time and feedback, some functionality was cut (most notably the slide out menu). This meant that I only implemented in the modal windows for our site. This task was very easy to do, I had already implemented this feature from DECO1400 as well so it didn't take long to create. You can click the button below to see an example.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subBox" id="partBYear">
        <h1>Year Page</h1>
        <section class="seperator" id="partBYearSep">
        </section>
        <br>
        <p>The year page was prehaps the most difficult to do because it involved developing a story and finding the motivation for why the user would want to advance in the story. I started with having the story be a very basic "help this person to get something", this way I could focus on getting the coding and assets done. Since we already had a year page completed and the wireframes I produced earlier, it was very easy to lay everything out in consistent fashion. The page relied mostly on HTML and CSS, with a few JavaScript functions to control the modals and text. I had also made some functions relating to localstorage retreival, however I decided against implementing this into the project as I felt that updating everything to work with it was too time consuming and wouldn't have enough of an impact to justify the time used.</p>

        <h1>Dashboard</h1>
        <section class="seperator" id="partBDashSep">
        </section>
        <br>
        <p>The dashboard design involved a simple layout with 2 seperators to break apart 3 sections. I made the general layout/design, Brian would then take over in placing the objects and getting some of the functionality to work.</p>

        <p>My name is Jiaxi Zhou (Josh) and I am currently working towards a dual degree at UQ. My choice of study is Information Technology and Science, majoring in software design and mathematics.
          <br><br>
          I was born in China and grew up an only child. At the age of 5 my family moved out to live in New Zealand where I would spend most of life and eventually become a citizen.
          At the start of 2014 I moved out to Cairns, Australia, and eventually transitioned to Brisbane at the start of 2017 after graduating high school.
          <br><br>
          I was always a fan of rugby growing up, espicially in primary, playing during lunch breaks or when ever I could and always cheering for the All Blacks when ever the RWC was on (sorry aussies). As I got older, my interests moved away from sports and more towards tech. I built my first computer back in 2015 and still use it today (well, parts of it).
          <br><br>
          In my spare time, I like to play video games and hang out with friends. I enjoy having long discussions on various subjects and interacting with others, whether that be academic or social. Space and astrophysics is also very interesting to me, wondering about the universe and when humans will finally master the art of interplanatery travel always makes me wish I could see into the future.
          <br><br>
          I'll conclude with
          Moving on...
